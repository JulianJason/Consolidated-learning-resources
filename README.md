# Consolidated-learning-resources

Below are several repositories that I find very useful for learning computer science. Enjoy!

#### [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)

 - A fairly new repository that has been traction in the past few days.
 - Amazing learning resources and generally is my go to for learning
 

 #### [Programming books e-library](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)
 
 - A huge repository for programming books that I will never finish.
 - Still proves useful when you need to compare chapters

#### [Engineering blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs)

- A list of tech blogs by engineers themselves, not journalists.
- Tend to be more in-depth 
- A very good resource to keep yourself updated with current tech trends.
 

#### [Free code camp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp)

- A plethora of DIY tutorials to get your hands wet for making projects including:
- front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap)
- Back end (Node.js, Express, and MongoDB)
- And specific trending frameworks (React, SASS, D3)
 
#### Interview preparatory links (no links for copyrighted book)

- Cracking the coding interview (Book)
- Programming interviews exposed (Book)
- [Google's "Director of Engineering" Hiring Test](http://www.gwan.com/blog/20160405.html)
- [MIT grad's interview experience](http://kelukelu.me/interview/index.html)

## And of course

#### [The awesome list that inspired me](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- MUCH more complete and is constantly being updated
- The only reason I'm making this is because that list is very intimidating.
